### Modifying Python Modules or Dockerfile
If you wish to add, remove, or update any Python modules in this repository, you can use `pip` commands as usual. After you finish modifying Python modules or Dockerfile, run the following command:
```shell
docker compose up --build -d && docker image prune --force && docker compose stop;
```
The command above re-builds the Docker Image with the new python modules you modified and removes old Docker Image.
